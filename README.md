# PSP Example Collection

This repository is a collection of examples demonstrating the use of various libraries on the PlayStation Portable (PSP). It serves as a practical resource for developers looking to explore PSP development.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the examples, ensure you have the following installed:

- **PSPSDK**: Essential for PSP development. Install it from [here](https://github.com/pspdev/pspdev).
- **PSPLink**: A useful tool for debugging. More information and download available at [PSPLink's website](http://pspdev.github.io/psplinkusb/).

## PSPSDK Documentation

For detailed documentation and additional resources on PSPSDK, visit [pspdev.github.io/pspsdk/](https://pspdev.github.io/pspsdk/).

## Setting Up Includes in VSCode

To properly configure your Visual Studio Code environment, add these lines to your include path:

```plaintext
${workspaceFolder}/**
${PSPDEV}/include
${PSPDEV}/psp/include
${PSPDEV}/psp/sdk/include
```
This setup ensures that the IDE correctly locates all necessary headers and libraries for PSP development.
